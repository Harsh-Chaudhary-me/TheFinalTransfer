The Final Transfer
The Final Transfer (also known as Digital Value Vault) is a secure, specialized platform designed for the seamless and protected transfer of digital assets. In an era where digital legacies and high-value assets are increasingly common, this platform provides a robust framework to ensure that your digital wealth—from credentials to sensitive data—is transferred to the intended recipients with absolute security and integrity.

The project focuses on high-level security protocols and a user-centric methodology to handle "digital inheritance" and asset management. Built using a modern TypeScript-based architecture, it emphasizes data privacy, encrypted storage, and a reliable verification system to ensure that your digital assets are never lost or inaccessible when they are needed most.

Getting Started Locally
Prerequisites
Node.js: Version 18.0 or higher is recommended.

Package Manager: You should have npm (comes with Node) or yarn installed.

Installation
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-final-transfer.git
Navigate to the Directory:

Bash

cd the-final-transfer
Install Dependencies:

Bash

npm install
How to Run and Test
This is a TypeScript project. To run it locally, follow these steps:

1. Start the Development Server
This will run the project in development mode with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

Bash

npm run dev
Once running, open your browser to the URL shown in your terminal (typically http://localhost:5173).

2. Check for Type Errors
Since this is a TypeScript project, you can verify the code's structural integrity by running:

Bash

npm run build
If there are any "Type Errors," the build will fail, allowing you to catch bugs before they reach production.

3. Testing the Logic
If you have added custom logic for asset transfers:

Open the browser's Developer Tools (F12) to monitor the Console for successful logs.

Check the Network tab to ensure any mock data or API calls are being handled correctly.

Project Structure Notes
/src: Contains all TypeScript source files.

/public: Static assets like logos and icons.

tsconfig.json: Configuration for the TypeScript compiler.
